# CS7IS4-Text-Analytics Assignments and Project
Welcome to my GitHub repository for the CS7IS4-Text-Analytics module at Trinity College Dublin. This repository contains the weekly readings and research notebook entries, as well as the project files completed by me.

The objective of the module was to learn about text analytics techniques and how to apply them to various types of data. The weekly readings and research notebook entries involved exploring various text analytics topics and techniques. The project involved applying text analytics techniques to a real-world dataset and producing a report and other project-related documents.

The repository contains the following files and folders:

- Weekly: Folder containing the weekly readings and research notebook entries.
  - Readings Week: Subfolder containing the readings for each week.
  - Research Notebook Entry: Subfolder containing the research notebook entries for each week.
-Project: Folder containing all the files for the project.
  - Codes: Subfolder containing the code for the project.
  - Ambassador Reports: Subfolder containing the reports for the ambassador role in the project.
  - Statement of Contribution: Text file containing the statement of contribution for the project.
  - Timesheet: Excel file containing the timesheet for the project.
  - Meeting Minutes: Subfolder containing the minutes of the meetings for the project.
  - Report: Subfolder containing the report for the project.
- README.md: This file.

To use the code for the project, you will need to have the required software and libraries installed on your system. The Codes subfolder contains the code for the project.

The Ambassador Reports subfolder contains the reports for the ambassador role in the project. The Statement of Contribution text file contains the statement of contribution for the project. The Timesheet Excel file contains the timesheet for the project. The Meeting Minutes subfolder contains the minutes of the meetings for the project. The Report subfolder contains the report for the project, which contains the insights drawn from the data using various text analytics techniques.

I hope that this repository and the weekly readings, research notebook entries, and project files it contains will be useful for those interested in learning about text analytics and applying it to real-world data.
